# Mc-Pipeline-Tools
A small set of scripts/tools created for making minecraft assets in Autodesk maya easier.

## Installing any scripts
I simplified the main scripts to work as a drag and drop install, in case of any errors, I have included the actual individual scripts

## Installing side scripts
I have write all scripts to work as buttons, simply in maya create a new button, paste the code and set it to `Python`, Done.

## Insatlling any python lib in maya
1. Open CMD in (Maya install)/bin location
2. Type `mayapy -m pip install` with whatever library you may need
For example `mayapy -m pip install Pillow`
